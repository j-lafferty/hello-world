Test Project: An Intro To GitHub

Hi There!

I'm just starting my coding journey and thought it would be a good idea to become familiar with GitHub. I intend to use GitHub to house all of my projects as I progress through my learning material. This will include my projects from school, as well as other on-line resources--Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, etc.. Eventually, I will transistion to contributing on OSS projects.

Thanks for reading!
